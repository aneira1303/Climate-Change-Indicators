Climate change indicators are specific measures that reflect the extent and impact of climate change. These indicators are critical for understanding how the climate is changing over time and for assessing the impacts on ecosystems, human health, and economies. 
Here is a brief description about the project-
The time series plot can show the temperature changes with respect to years.
The Box plot is used to show the distribution of temperature changes with decade.
The Heatmap shows how much increase of temperature has taken place in which country and which year.
We can also predict the difference of temperature with its ratio given of two consecutive years.
We can also predict the coming temperature with the given years temperature.
